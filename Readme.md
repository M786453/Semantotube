## Purpose

Our application aims to make it easier for users to find and access the information they need within the specified video. By using the Cohere API, we are able to perform advanced semantic searches that go beyond simple keyword matching, allowing users to find content relevant to their query in the specified video. Our application utilizes the Cohere API to locate and highlight the specific transcript within the video that matches their search. This makes it easier for users to quickly find and access the information they need, without having to manually search through the entire video. Overall, our application is a game-changer for anyone looking to find and access specific information within YouTube videos. Whether you're a student looking for a specific lecture, a researcher trying to locate a specific quote, or just someone looking for information on a particular topic, our application makes it easier than ever to find what you need.
